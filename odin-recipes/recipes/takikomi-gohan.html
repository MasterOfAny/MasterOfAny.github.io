            <ul class="instructions__list">
                <li class="instruction__item">Wash the rice in a large bowl. Rice absorbs water very quickly when you
                    start washing, so don't let the rice absorb the
                    opaque water. Gently wash the rice in a circular motion and discard the water. Repeat this process
                    about 3-4 times.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Let the rice soak in water for 30-60 minutes. This helps the rice absorb
                    the seasonings later on and become more tender
                    and moist after cooking. Transfer the rice into a sieve and drain completely for at least 15
                    minutes. Place the washed
                    and drained rice in the rice cooker.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients. Soak 3 dried shiitake mushrooms
                    in a 1/2 cup of water for 15 minutes. I place a
                    smaller bowl on top to keep the mushrooms submerged in the water at all times.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to boil. Put ⅓ konnyaku and
                    cook for 1 minute to get rid of the smell.
                    Transfer the konnyaku to a plate to cool. Add the aburaage to the same pot of water and cook for 1
                    minute. This removes
                    excess oil from the aburaage. Transfer aburaage to a plate to cool. Discard the water.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Shave off the gobo skin with the back of the knife. Don’t peel the gobo
                    with a peeler to keep the earthy flavor and
                    fragrance. Then make a “cross” slit on tip of the gobo as you see in the picture below.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Make a lengthwise cross-shape incision about 1 1/2 inch (3.8 cm) deep at
                    one end. Shave from that end as if you were
                    sharpening a pencil with a knife while constantly rotating with the other hand. Soak in the water to
                    prevent it from
                    changing color.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Cut the carrot in half lengthwise and cut diagonally into thin slices.
                    Then cut the slices into julienned or smaller
                    pieces.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Cut the aburaage and konnyaku into thin small strips.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Cut the chicken thigh into 3/4 inch (2 cm) slanted pieces. Hold your knife
                    at 45-degree angle and slice the chicken. This
                    “sogigiri” cutting technique gives the chicken more surface area so it will cook faster and soak up
                    flavors quickly.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Squeeze the liquid from dried shiitake mushrooms and save the liquid (this
                    is called Shiitake Dashi). Remove the stem
                    and cut the caps into thinly slices.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Strain the Shiitake Dashi into a bowl through a fine mesh strainer to get
                    rid of dirty particles. Set aside. In a
                    measuring cup, add all the shiitake dashi and then pour dashi so you’ll have 1 1/2 cup (360 ml) of
                    liquid. Add it to the
                    rice cooker and mix well.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Add 1 1/2 Tbsp soy sauce and 1 1/2 Tbsp mirin to the rice.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Pour the dashi & shiitake dashi mixture into the rice and mix well.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Add the chicken and evenly distribute over the rice. Do NOT mix the rice
                    with ingredients. The rice won’t be able to
                    absorb enough water to cook and it will end up with a hard texture. Continue from the hard
                    ingredients to softer
                    ingredients. Without mixing all up, start cooking the rice. If you have a “Mixed Rice” option, use
                    it (See Notes below).</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Once the rice is done cooking, use a rice paddle to stir the rice and
                    vegetables with light slicing and tossing motions
                    to distribute the ingredients evenly. The bottom of the rice gets slightly caramelized, and this
                    part is called Okoge
                    and it’s especially tasty.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Serve the rice hot or at room temperature. Sprinkle chopped mitsuba or
                    green onion on top.</li>
