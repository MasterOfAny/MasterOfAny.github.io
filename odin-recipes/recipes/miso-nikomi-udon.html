                Miso Nikomi Udon is a hearty and comforting noodle soup where chicken, fish cake, and udon noodles are
                simmered in a
                miso-flavored dashi broth. When it’s cold outside, this noodle soup will warm you inside out.

            <span class="instructions__header">instructions</span>
            <ul class="instructions__list">
                <li class="instruction__item">Make 3 cups dashi.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Cut the end of shimeji mushrooms and separate into smaller chunks.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Cut the stem of shiitake mushrooms and cut in halves.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Cut Kamaboko fish cake into 4 slices.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Cut the Negi (long green onion) diagonally, and separate white and green
                    parts (we will add them to the pot at different
                    times).</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Pour hot water over aburaage to get rid of the factory oil. Some people
                    skip the step as the oil used is cleaner these
                    days. I do it anyway to get rid of excess oil. [Optional] Cut into smaller pieces. I cut into
                    triangles.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Cut the chicken into smaller bite-size pieces. I use "sogigiri" technique
                    to create a bigger surface of the chicken so
                    it will cook faster and absorb more flavors.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the frozen udon noodles and loosen it
                    with chopsticks. As soon as they are loosened
                    (30 seconds or so), drain the udon noodles into a colander and set aside. If you use dry noodles,
                    follow the package
                    instructions.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Crack eggs into a small bowl (so you won’t accidentally drop an egg shell
                    into the pot) and make sure all ingredients
                    are now ready to go!</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">In a large pot (or donabe), add 3 cups dashi, chicken, and white part of
                    negi.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Cover to cook on medium heat for 10 minutes, or until the outside of the
                    chicken is no longer pink (inside can be still
                    pink at this stage). When boiling, turn the heat down to simmer. Skim off the fat and scum with a
                    fine mesh skimmer.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Add 3 Tbsp mirin and 3 Tbsp miso (keep 1 Tbsp for later. Why? Read my
                    post.). I use a Miso Muddler and it works
                    wonderfully to make sure miso is dissolved completely. You should place miso in a ladle and use
                    chopsticks to let miso
                    dissolve inside the ladle before releasing it into the dashi. That way you can make sure there are
                    no miso chunks left
                    at the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Add udon noodles, aburaage, shimeji mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, and
                    green part of negi. If you care about the
                    presentation of this dish, now is a good time to place each ingredient and fish out the chicken
                    pieces and place on top
                    of udon noodles.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Increase the heat to medium, cover with the lid, and cook for 5 minutes.
                    When boiling, turn the heat down to simmer.
                    Once in a while, make sure to check udon or other ingredients are not stuck on the bottom of the
                    pot, by inserting
                    cooking chopsticks. Skim off the fat and scum with a fine mesh skimmer.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Add 1 Tbsp miso in the soup. Be careful not to drop the chunk of miso.
                    Use a ladle as a “mixing bowl” so you won’t lose
                    the miso.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Add kamaboko fish cakes (where it could have a nice color) and carefully
                    drop the eggs in the middle. From this point,
                    you do not want to cover with the lid (egg yolk will have a thin white coating when you cover). Cook
                    for 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li class="instruction__item">Serve the pot at the table along with individual bowls. Serve in the bowl
                    and sprinkle Shichimi Togarashi for a bit of
                    spicy kick.</li>
